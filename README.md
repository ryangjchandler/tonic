# Tonic

An elegant language for script-kiddies and terminal squatters.

## About

I started Tonic to complete the Advent of Code 2021. My eventual goal is to make this a viable language for writing shell scripts and other small utilities too.

At the minute it's pretty barebones and could do with a huge performance boost. A recursive `fib(30)` function takes roughly 1.5 seconds to complete, which isn't great.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute, please feel free to take a look at some of the [issues](/issues) or perhaps did through the code and find some better ways to do things. I'm still fairly new to the programming language thing so any help and criticism is welcome.
